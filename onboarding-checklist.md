## Directions ##

**Onboardee and buddy:** Try to go through your checklists in order.

**Buddy:** If you canâ€™t complete any of the items on your checklist
personally, *you are responsible for ensuring that someone with the
correct access completes that item.*

## Onboardee checklist ##

### Getting to know VM Fusion ###

- [ ] Take notes on anything that is confusing or frustrating during your
onboarding process.
  - Please share this information with your buddy and the team so we can
  make things better.
  - If you notice a problem (especially with things like documentation), you
  are more than welcome to fix it!
  - You can also file issues and pull requests against the [template
    onboarding checklist].
- [ ] Meet with your onboarding buddy (they should reach out to you).
- [ ] Once you've finished the checklists below, make suggestions for steps
that would have improved your onboarding experience as pull requests on the
[template onboarding checklist] used to make this issue.

### Required items for all team members ###

Completing these items helps us fulfill security and compliance requirements.
If you get stuck, or if these requirements are confusing, ask for help from
your onboarding buddy.

#### GitHub ####

- [ ] If you don't already have a GitHub account,
[create a GitHub account with your government email address](https://github.com/join).
- [ ] If you already have a GitHub account, [add your government email address](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/adding-an-email-address-to-your-github-account).
- [ ] Go through the [FISMA-Ready GitHub guide](https://github.com/fisma-ready/github)
to set up your GitHub account to be added to CISA.
- [ ] Once your GitHub account has been added to the `cisagov` organization,
make sure you're assigned to this issue.

#### Mandatory training ####

- [ ] Complete Cybersecurity Training at the CISA Course Management
      website, including Mandatory Cyber Security and Privacy
      Training, and acceptance of the Rules of Behavior, which are
      both required before we can give you access to any systems,
      including CISA GWE (Google Workspace Enterprise).

### CISA Google Workspace Enterprise ###

In addition to your CISA email address `first.last@cisa.dhs.gov`,
you'll also get an account on CISA GWE, which is a Google Workspace
account used for cross-team and cross-agency collaboration and is
generally `first.last@gwe.cisa.dhs.gov`. Your CISA GWE account may
take a few days to get set up.

Once your CISA GWE account is set up, ask a dev team member to help
you perform the following:

- [ ] Join the appropriate rooms in Google Chat.
- [ ] Join the appropriate Google Groups so you can participate in
      team-wide internal communication.
- [ ] Get access to the Google Drive dev team share.  If you create or
      move a doc there, it'll get the right access permissions for
      team members to be able to view and edit it.
- [ ] Get access to the dev team's shared Google Calendar.

## Useful links ##

- [ ] [NCATS Data Dictionary](https://github.com/cisagov/ncats-data-dictionary)
repo for information about what's stored in the CyHy environment MongoDB databases
- [ ] [COOL Wiki](https://github.com/cisagov/cool-system-internal) -
      Although they do not currently display as a wiki because this is
      a private repository (for historical reasons; ask another dev
      for the backstory), this collection of Markdown pages was
      exported from what was once an actual GitHub wiki in a public
      repository.  We maintain these pages in the hope that they can
      again be made public one day.
- [ ] [CyHy Wiki](https://github.com/cisagov/cyhy-system/wiki/)
- [ ] Set up your [environment on your CISA-provided Mac laptop](/dev_envs/mac-env-setup.md).

## Buddy checklist ##

- [ ] Introduce yourself to the new team member and talk about your
      background so they know who you are.
- [ ] Identify a straightforward and well-defined first issue, ideally
      something the new team member could conceivably complete in
      their first two/three weeks using their existing skills. Discuss
      the context with them, then make them the assignee.
- [ ] Discuss suggestions for how the onboarding experience could have
      been improved and open as PRs on the [template onboarding
      checklist].
- [ ] Invite the new team member to all relevant recurring meetings.
- [ ] Invite the new team member to all relevant [GitHub cisagov
      teams](https://github.com/orgs/cisagov/teams/).
